## 1. High-Level Overview (User Perspective)

easySchedule is a scheduling platform with two main personas:

- Host: sets availability, connects Google Calendar, receives bookings.
- Client: views open time slots and requests a booking.

When a host clicks Connect Google Calendar, the app asks Google for permission, then stores a secure long-lived credential (encrypted refresh token). Later, when calendar API calls are needed, the app gets
short-lived access tokens on demand.

## 2. Key User Flows (Derived from Code)

### A) Login flow (OAuth + JWT + refresh)

1. User starts OAuth login via Spring Security /oauth2/**.
2. CustomOAuth2UserService normalizes provider attributes (provider, providerUserId, email, name).
3. OAuth2AuthenticationSuccessHandler resolves/creates local user identity.
4. Backend returns:
    - JWT access token (JwtTokenProvider)
    - Rotating refresh token (RefreshTokenService)
5. Later, /auth/refresh validates refresh token and rotates it, issuing a new JWT.

### B) Connect calendar flow (/integrations/calendar/google/*)

1. Authenticated user calls GET /integrations/calendar/google/connect.
2. CalendarOAuthService.buildGoogleConnectUrl() builds Google consent URL with client_id, scopes, redirect URI, state.
3. User consents at Google; Google redirects to GET /integrations/calendar/google/callback?code&state.
4. handleGoogleCallback():
    - validates state
    - exchanges code for tokens
    - fetches provider user ID
    - stores encrypted refresh token (or reuses existing if refresh token not returned)
    - stores connection metadata (status, scopes, token expiry metadata)
5. User is redirected to frontend success/error page.

### C) Booking creation flow (POST /api/bookings)

1. Request must include Idempotency-Key.
2. BookingController hashes request payload for idempotency matching.
3. IdempotencyService attempts insert-first lock row in idempotency_keys.
4. If first request:
    - calls BookingService.createBooking()
    - booking is persisted
    - outbox event is published in same transaction (OutboxPublisher)
    - idempotency row finalized with cached response
5. If duplicate request:
    - same hash + terminal status => replay response
    - hash mismatch => error
    - still processing => poll then return in-progress/replay result

### D) Availability calculation flow

1. Client calls GET /api/users/{userId}/event-types/{eventTypeId}/slots?date=....
2. SlotService loads host + event type.
3. Reads slot cache version; checks cache.
4. On miss, computes from:
    - availability rules
    - override for date
    - existing overlapping bookings
    - DB clock (SELECT now())
5. Returns slots with deterministic slot IDs.
6. Note from current code: calendarBusy is currently List.of() in slot generation path.

### E) Background processing flow (outbox + sync)

1. Booking writes outbox_events.
2. OutboxWorker polls every second:
    - atomically claims rows (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED)
    - dispatches event (current default dispatcher logs only)
    - marks PROCESSED or RETRYING/FAILED
3. OutboxReaper runs every 30s to recover stuck PROCESSING rows.
4. Sync pipeline also exists:
    - OutboxProcessor converts booking outbox events to calendar_sync_jobs
    - BookingSyncWorker processes sync jobs and calls CalendarService.

## 3. Behind the Scenes (Technical, Simple)

- JWT strategy: stateless auth via bearer token; JWT subject is user UUID.
- Refresh token strategy (auth): refresh tokens are validated and rotated.
- Google calendar OAuth: separate from login OAuth; uses google.oauth.* config and explicit connect/callback endpoints.
- No access-token persistence for calendar: connection stores encrypted refresh token and token-expiry metadata; access token is fetched at use time via refresh flow.
- Refresh token encryption: AesGcmTokenCipher (AES-GCM with IV + versioned ciphertext prefix).
- Connection lifecycle: ACTIVE, ERROR, REVOKED, DISCONNECTED with last_error_code + last_error_at.
- Outbox reliability model:
    - transactional write with business data
    - claim with row locking
    - retry/backoff
    - stuck-row reaper
    - processed-events guard to avoid duplicate dispatch

## 6. Key Technical Decisions (From Code)

- Access tokens not stored: reduces persistence of short-lived bearer credentials; token is fetched when needed.
- Refresh tokens encrypted: refresh token is high-value secret; AES-GCM protects at rest.
- Scopes as array (TEXT[]): enables DB-native querying (ANY(scopes)) and indexing (GIN).
- Unique user/provider constraint: enforces one canonical calendar connection per provider per user.
- Lifecycle tracking fields: status, last_error_code, last_error_at, last_synced_at improve observability and recovery logic.
- Outbox pattern: ensures async side effects are tied to successful DB commits and recoverable with retries.

## 7. Real End-to-End Scenario Walkthrough

1. Host logs in with Google OAuth login and receives JWT + refresh token.
2. Host calls /integrations/calendar/google/connect, approves calendar access at Google.
3. Callback stores encrypted calendar refresh token and marks connection ACTIVE.
4. Client requests slots for a date; backend computes from availability + existing bookings.
5. Client submits booking with Idempotency-Key.
6. Backend saves booking and outbox event atomically.
7. Worker picks outbox event and processes async pipeline.
8. When a calendar API call is needed, TokenRefresher decrypts refresh token, gets short-lived access token, executes API call.
9. If token refresh fails (e.g., revoked grant), connection state is updated (ERROR/REVOKED) with error metadata.

———

## 8. Current Capabilities vs Future Work

### ✅ Implemented (in code now)

- JWT auth filter and refresh endpoint.
- OAuth login normalization/success handling.
- Google calendar connect/callback endpoints.
- Encrypted refresh-token storage for calendar.
- Non-persistent access-token model for calendar integration.
- Booking + idempotency + transactional outbox.
- Outbox worker retry/reaper mechanics.
- Hardened calendar_connections schema (unique index, array scopes, lifecycle fields).

### 🔜 Missing / next logical steps

1. Integrate real external dispatcher for outbox default path (current default is logging dispatcher).
2. Ensure full calendar busy-time integration in slot calculation path (currently empty list in SlotService compute path).
3. Expand last_synced_at usage in sync job completion/update paths.
4. Tighten secret defaults in config for production deployments.
